# Poverty classification using Machine Learning

This project presents an application of the association between machine learning methods and eligibility tests such as proxy means test (PMT). We propose a discussion about the applicability of machine learning models in classifying beneficiaries of poverty reduction programs, assuming the hypothesis that these methods can improve selection mechanisms and improve policy targeting. The empirical exercise carried out uses data from the Continuous PNAD and adjusts a household/family classification model according to their poverty status.
